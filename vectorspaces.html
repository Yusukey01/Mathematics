        <h1>Vector Space</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A <strong>real vector space</strong> is a nonempty set \(V\) of vectors on which are 
            defined <strong>addition</strong> and <strong>scalar multiplication</strong> subject to
            the following eight axioms. 
            
            <br><br>\(\forall u, v, w \in V\) and scalars \(c, d \in \mathbb{R}\), 
            <ol>
                <li>Commutativity of vector addition: \(u + v = v + u\)</li>
                <li>Associativity of vector addition: \((u + v) + w = u + (v + w)\)</li>
                <li>Additive identity element: \(\exists 0 \in V\) s.t. \(u + 0 = u\)</li>
                <li>Additive inverse element: \(\forall u \in V, \exists -u\) s.t. \(u + (-u) = 0\)</li>
                <li>Multiplicative identity: \(1u = u\)</li>
                <li>Distributivity of scalar multiplication wrt vector addition : \(c(u + v) = cu + cv\)</li>
                <li>Distributivity of scalar multiplication wrt scalar addditon: \((c + d)u = cu + du\)</li>
                <li>Compatibility of scalar multiplication: \(c(du)=(cd)u\)</li>      
            </ol>

        From now on, in the linear algebra section, "vector space" means "real" vector space. If we need to use
        the <strong>complex vector space</strong> whose scalars \(c, d \in \mathbb{C}\), I will mention it. To understand
        a more general setting, you must know <strong>abstract algebra</strong> ideas, but the current definition is enough for now.
        A simple example of the vector space is \(\mathbb{R}^n\), where \(n \geq 1\). This is why we introduced this concept. 
        <br><br>
        From the definition, \(\forall u \in V \text{and scalar } c\), 
        \[0u =0\]
        \[c0 =0\]
        \[-u =(-1)u\]
        \[cu =0 \Longrightarrow c=0 \text{ or } u =0\]
        <br><br>
        A <strong>subspace</strong> of a vector space \(V\) is a subset \(H\) of \(V\) that has following properties:
        <ol>
            <li>The zero vector of \(V\) is in \(H\)</li>
            <li>\(H\) is closed under vector addition: \(\forall u, v \in H, \quad u+v \in H\)</li>
            <li>\(H\) is closed under scalar multiplication: \(\forall u in H\, \text{ scalar } c, \quad cu \in H\)</li>
               
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        For example, a vector space \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is NOT subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) because \(\mathbb{R}^2\) 
        is NOT subset of \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
        <br><br>
        Remember, a <strong>linear combination</strong> is any "sum" of "scalar multiples" of vectors. Also, 
        \(Span\{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_p\}\) is the set of all linear combinations of \(v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_p\).
        \[\textbf{Theorem} \qquad text{If } v_1, \cdots, v_p \in V text{, then } Span\{v_1, \cdots, v_p \} 
        text{ is a subspace of } V.\]
