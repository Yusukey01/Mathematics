            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Theorem 1: Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem</span> 
                Suppose a function \(f\) is a continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b)\). Then 
                there exists a number \(c \in (a, b)\) such that
                \[
                f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \tag{1}
                \]

            Note: The special case of this theorem: if \(f(a) = f(b)\), then f'(c) = 0. is called <strong>Rolle's Theorem</strong>. 
            We ommit the proof but the outile of the proof can be: 
            <br>
            case 1: \(f(x)\) is constant, \(f'(x)\) = 0 for all \(c \in (a,b)\).
            <br>
            case 2: \(f(x) > f(a)\), show that at \(c\), \(f\) has local maximum, then \(f'(c) = 0\) by the Extrem Value Theorem
            <br>
            case 3: \(f(x) < f(a)\), similarly, show that at \(c\), \(f\) has local minimum, then \(f'(c) = 0\)
            <div class="proof">

                Suppose a function \(f\) is a continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b)\).
                <br>
                Consider the line connecting \(a, f(a)\) and \(b, f(b)\). The equation of the line can be written as 
                \[
                y - f(a) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b -a} (x - a)
                \]
                Let g(x) be the vertical difference between \(x, f(x)\) and (x, y). Then 
                \[
                g(x) = f(x) - f(a) - \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b -a} (x -a) \tag{2}
                \]
                \(g\) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b)\) because \(g\) is the sum of \(f\) 
                and the first-degree polynomial, both of which are continuous and differentialble on the same interval. 
                <br>
                From Equation (2), 
                \[
                g'(x) = f'(x) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b -a} 
                \]
                Also, clearly, \(g(a) = g(b) = 0\). Thus, by Rolle's Theorem 
                \[
                \exists c \in (a,b) \text{  such that } g'(c) = 0
                \]
                This implies 
                \[
                g'(c) = f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b -a}  = 0
                \]
                and so 
                \[
                f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b -a}
                \]
            </div>

        <h1>Taylor's Theorem</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Equivalently, Equation (1) can be written as
            \[
            f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b - a)
            \]
            This is the Taylor's Theorem on \([a, b]\) with \(n = 1\).
            <div class="theorem">
                <span class="theorem-title">Theorem 2: Taylor's Theorem</span> 
                Let \(n \geq 1\) be an integer and let \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) be \(n\) times 
                differentiable at \(a \in \mathbb{R}\). Then there exists \(g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) 
                such that 
                \[
                f(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k !}(x - a)^k + g_n (x) (x - a)^n
                \]
                and 
                \[
                \lim_{x \to a} g_n(x) = 0.
                \]
            </div>
            Note: \(g_n (x) (x - a)^n \) represents the reminder. An alternative and commonly used form of the 
            remainder is the <strong>Lagrange's form of reminder</strong>:
            \[
            R_n (x) = \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x-a)^n \text{ where } c \in (a, x)
            \]
            Another common representation of the remainder, particularly in <strong>asymptotic analysis</strong>, is:
            \[
            R_n (x) = \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n + o(\| x -a \|^n)
            \]
            where the little-o notation \(o(| x -a |^n)\) indicates that the term converges to 0 faster than 
            \(| x -a |^n\) as \(x \to a\).
            <br>
            The polynomial appearing in Taylor's Theorem is called <strong>n-th order Taylor polynomial</strong>:
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            T_n (x) &= f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x -a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x -a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n \\\\
                    &= \sum_{k = 0}^{n} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}(x - a)^n 
            \end{align*}
            \]
            Also, as \(n \to \infty\), if the function \(f\) is infinitely differentiable and the remainder term \(R_n (x)\) 
            tends to zero, Taylor series expansion becomes:
            \[
            f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}(x - a)^n 
            \]
            This is <strong>Taylor series</strong> of the function \(f\) centered at \(a\). The series converges to \(f\) within 
            it radius of convergence. So, Taylor polynomials are used for approximation of \(f(x)\). For example, the 1st order Taylor 
            polynomial 
            \[
            T_1 (x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
            \] 
            is equivalent ot the <strong>linearlization </strong> of \(f\) at \(a\), providing a first-order approximation.

                \]
            </div>
            Note: when \(g(x) = x\), this theorem becomes Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem.
