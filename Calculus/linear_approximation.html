        <h1>Linear Approximations</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Linear approximation</strong> is a process of approximation a function (\f(x)\) near a point 
            \(x_o\) using a linear function. It simplifies complex functions locally.
            \[
            L(x) = f(x_o) + f'(x_o)(x -x_o) \approx f(x) \tag{1}
            \]
            where \(f'(x_o) = \lim_{x \to x_o} \frac{f(x)-f(x_o)}{x-x_o}\) is derivative at \(x_o\). 
            <br>
            Equivalently, from equation (1), 
            \[
            f(x) - f(x_o) \approx f'(x_o)(x -x_o) 
            \]
            <br><br>
            \(L(x)\) is called the <strong>linearization</strong> of \(f\) at \(x_o\). the graph of \(L\) is 
            the tangent line at \((x_o, f(x_o))\). Linear approximations form the foundation of differentiation 
            and provide a local linear model for \(f(x)\). This concept extends naturally to  differentials.

        <h1>Differentials</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Differentials</strong> describe infinitesimally small changes in quantities. 
            If \(y = f(x)\), where \(f\) differentiable, then the differential \(dx\) is 
            an independent variable and the differential \(dy\) is defined as 
            \[
            dy = f'(x)dx. 
            \]
            In practice, \(dx\) and \(dy\) are arbitrary small numbers. Also, if \(dx \neq 0\), then 
            we recover the familiar derivative form:
            \[
            \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)
            \]
            where the left side now represents the ratio of differentials.
            <br><br>
            The exact change in \(y\) corresponding to change in \(x\),(\(dx\)) is given by:
            \[
            \delta y  = f(x + dx) -f(x).  
            \]
            As \(dx \to 0\), the approximation improves
            \[
            dy = f'(x)dx \approx \delta y = f(x + dx) -f(x).
            \] 
            More precisely, the relationship can be written as:
            \[
            f(x + dx) - f(x) = f'(x)dx + o(dx),
            \]
            where \(o(dx)\) is the asymptotic notation, which represents higher-order terms that become negligible as \(dx \to 0\). 
            This highlights that the differential \(dy = f'(x)dx\) serves as a linear approximation to \(\delta y\).
            <br><br>
            More generally, the differential of \(f\) can be expressed as:
            \[
            df = f(x + dx) - f(x) = f'(x)dx,
            \] 
            where \(df\) represents the linearized change in \(f(x)\) due to an infinitesimally small change in \(x\).
            <br>
            Here, \(df\) is the change in the output, \(dx\) is the change in the input, and most importantly, 
            \(f'(x)\) acts as a <strong>linear operator</strong> that maps \(dx\) to \(df\). 
            <br>
            The flexibility of differential notation extends naturally to <strong>linear algebra</strong>, where derivatives 
            apply not only to scalars \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), but also to vectors \(\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) and 
            matrices \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\).
