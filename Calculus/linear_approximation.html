        <h1>Linear Approximations</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Linear approximation</strong> refers to the process of approximation a function (\f(x)\) near a point 
            \(x_o\) using a linear function. It is used to simplify complex functions locally.
            \[
            L(x) = f(x_o) + f'(x_o)(x -x_o) \approx f(x)
            \]
            where \(f'(x_o) = \lim_{x \to x_o} \frac{f(x)-f(x_o)}{x-x_o}\) is derivative at \(x_o\). 
            <br><br>
            \(L(x)\) is called the <strong>linearization</strong> of \(f\) at \(x_o\). the graph of \(L\) is 
            the tangent line at \((x_o, f(x_o))\). In the end, the linear approximation is the core of differentiation 
            and the ideas behind linear approximations are differentials.

        <h1>Differentials</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Differentials</strong> are infinitely small change in some varying quantity. 
            If \(y = f(x)\), where \(f\) is a differentiable function, then the <strong>differential</strong> \(dx\) is 
            an independent variable and the differential \(dy\) is defined as 
            \[
            dy = f'(x)dx. 
            \]
            In practice, \(dx\) and \(dy\) are arbitrary small mumbers for numerical computations.
            Also, if \(dx \neq 0\), then
            \[
            \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x). 
            \]
            This equation exactly represents the ratio of differentials is equal to change of rate of \(f\)(=derivative of \(f\)).
            <br><br>
            Since we have learned linear algebra, you might notice that the differential notation is more flexible than other 
            representations of derivative. Now we can consider \(x\) as not only a scalar \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), but also a 
            vector \(\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \) or even a matrix \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\).
            <br>
            Change in \(y\) corresponding to change in \(x\), or \(dx\) represents 
            \[
            \delta y = (y - y_o) = f(x_o + dx) -f(x_o)  
            \]
            and as \(dx\) becomes smaller, the approximation 
            \[dy = f'(x)dx \approx delta y = f(x_o + dx) -f(x_o)\] 
            becomes more accurate: 
            \[
            dy = f'(x_o)dx = f(x_o + dx) -f(x_o)
            \]
            Then we obtain the more general definition of derivative of (\f\):
            \[
            df = f(x + dx) - f(x) = f'(x)dx. 
            \] 
            where \(df\) is the amount of change of the output, \(dx\) is the amount of change of the input, and we can consider 
            \(f'(x)\) as a <strong>linear operator </strong> acting on \(dx\).
