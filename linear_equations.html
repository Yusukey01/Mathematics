        <h1>Linear Equations</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A <strong>linear equation</strong> can be written in the form 
            <strong>\[a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b\] </strong>
            where \(x_1 \cdots x_n \) are variables and \(b\) and the coefficients \(a_1 \cdots a_n\) are real or complex numbers.
            The index \(n\) would be more than thousands or millions in practice. 
            <br> We call a collection of linear equations including the same variables a <strong>system of linear equations</strong>, which 
            is said to be consistent if it has either <strong>exactly one solution</strong> or <strong>infinitely many solutions</strong>. 
            Finally, it is possible that a system of linear equations has <strong>no solution</strong> (the system is inconsistent).
            <br><br>
            Now, We would like to store "information" of a system(=What are the values of each coefficient?, How many equations?, How many variables?) 
            into a rectangular array called a <strong>matrix</strong>.
            <br>For example, the linear system 
            \[
            \begin{align}
             x_1\phantom{+a_20x_2}-3x_3 + \phantom{0}x_4 &= 10 \\
            4x_1 -5x_2 + 6x_3 -2x_4 &= -8 \\
            \phantom{a_3x_1+} 2x_2 + 2x_3 +5x_4 &=6
            \end{align}
            \]
            can be written as the <strong>coefficient matrix</strong> of the system 
            \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & -3  & 1\\
            4 & -5 & 6  & -2\\
            0 & 2 & 2  & 5
            \end{bmatrix}
            \] (This is a \(3 \times 4\) (read"3 by 4") matrix. The number of rows(=3) always comes first.)
            or 
            <br> can be witten as the <strong>augmented matrix</strong> of the system
            \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & -3 & 1 & 10\\
            4 & -5 & 6 & -2 & -8\\
            0 & 2 & 2 &  5 & 6\\
            \end{bmatrix}
            \]
            (This is a \(3 \times 5\) matrix includes the constants from the right sides of the equations. The number of rows = 3, and the number of columns = 5).
            <br><br>
            How can we solve the linear system? The key idea is to replace the system with an equivalent system
            which is easier to solve than the original. What does "equivalent" mean here? There are three elementary row operations. 
            If there is a sequence of the operations that transforms a matrix into other matrix, the two matrices are called 
            <strong>row equivalent</strong>.  The elementary row operations are as follows.
            
            <ol>
                <li>Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row.(Replacement)</li>
                <li>Interchange two rows.(Interchange)</li>
                <li>Multiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant.(Scaling)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <br>
            \[
            \begin{align*}
            \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & -3 & 1 & 10\\
            4 & -5 & 6 & -2 & -8\\
            0 & 2 & 2 &  5 & 6\\
            \end{bmatrix}
            \xrightarrow{\text{Row2 $\leftrightarrow$ (Row2-4*Row1)}} 
            \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & -3 & 1 & 10\\
            0 & -5 & 18 & -6 & -48\\
            0 & 2 & 2 &  5 & 6\\
            \end{bmatrix}
            \xrightarrow{\text{Row2 $\leftrightarrow$ (Row2/-5)}} 
            \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & -3 & 1 & 10\\
            0 & 1 & \frac{-18}{5} & \frac{6}{5} & \frac{48}{5}\\
            0 & 2 & 2 &  5 & 6\\
            \end{bmatrix} \\ 
            <br>
            &\xrightarrow{\text{Next Step}}
            \begin{bmatrix}
            \cdots \\
            \end{bmatrix}
            \end{align*}

            \]
