        <h1>Linear Equations</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A <strong>linear equation</strong> can be written in the form 
            <strong>\[a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b\] </strong>
            where \(x_1 \cdots x_n \) are variables and \(b\) and the coefficients \(a_1 \cdots a_n\) are real or complex numbers.
            The index \(n\) would be more than thousands or millions in practice. 
            <br> We call a collection of linear equations including the same variables a <strong>system of linear equations</strong>, which 
            is said to be consistent if it has either <strong>exactly one solution</strong> or <strong>infinitely many solutions</strong>. 
            Finally, it is possible that a system of linear equations has <strong>no solution</strong> (the system is inconsistent).
            <br><br>
            Now, We would like to store "information" of a system(=What are the values of each coefficient?, How many equations?, How many variables?) 
            into a rectangular array called a <strong>matrix</strong>.
            <br>For example, the linear system 
            \[
            \begin{align}
             x_1\phantom{a_20x_2}-3x_3 + \phantom{0}x_4 &= 10 \\
            4x_1 -5x_2 + 6x_3 -2x_4 &= -8 \\
            \phantom{a_3x_1+} 2x_2 + 2x_3 +5x_4 &=6
            \end{align}
            \]
            can be written as the <strong>coefficient matrix</strong> of the system 
            \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & -3  & 1\\
            4 & -5 & 6  & -2\\
            0 & 2 & 2  & 5
            \end{bmatrix}
            \] (This is a \(3 \times 4\) (read"3 by 4") matrix. The number of rows(=3) always comes first.)
            or 
            <br> can be witten as the <strong>augmented matrix</strong> of the system
            \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & -3 & 1 & 10\\
            4 & -5 & 6 & -2 & -8\\
            0 & 2 & 2 &  5 & 6\\
            \end{bmatrix}
            \](This is a \(3 \times 5\) matrix includes the constants from the right sides of the equations. The number of rows = 3, and the number of columns = 5).
