        <h1>Linear Equations</h1>
        <blockquote>
            A linear equation can be written in the form 
            \[a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b\] 
            where \(x_1 \cdots x_n \) are variables and \(b\) and the coefficients \(a_1 \cdots a_n\) are real or complex numbers.
            The index \(n\) would be more than thousands or millions in practice. 
            <br> We call a collection of linear equations including the same variables a <strong>system of linear equations</strong>, which 
            is said to be consistent if it has either <strong>exactly one solution</strong> or <strong>infinitely many solutions</strong>. 
            Finally, it is possible that a system of linear equations has <strong>no solution</strong> (the system is inconsistent).
            <br><br>
            Now, We would like to store "information" of a system(=What are the values of each coefficient?,How many equations?,How many variables?) 
            into a rectangular array called a <strong>matrix</strong>.
            <br>For example, the linear system 
            \[
            \begin{align}
            x_1  \phantom{+a_2x_2} -3x_3 &= 10 \\
            4x_1 -5x_2 + 6x_3 &= -8
            \end{align}
            \]
            can be written as the <strong>coefficient matrix</strong> of the system 
            \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & -3 \\
            4 & -5 & 6 \\
            \end{bmatrix}
            \] (This is a \(2 \times 3\) (read"2 by 3") matrix. The number of rows(=2) always comes first.)
            or 
            <br> can be witten as the <strong>augmented matrix</strong> of the system
            \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & -3 & 10\\
            4 & -5 & 6 & -8\\
            \end{bmatrix}
            \](This is a \(2 \times 4\) matrix. The number of rows = 2, and the number of columns = 4).
