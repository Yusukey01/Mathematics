        <h1>Inner Product </h1>
        <blockquote>
            The <strong>inner product</strong> of vectors \(u, v \in \mathbb{R}^n \) is a single scalar
            \[u \cdot v = u^Tv = u_1v_1 + \cdots + u_nv_n.\]
            <br>
            Now we need the definition of the "length" in higher dimension. 
            The <strong>norm</strong> of a vector \(v \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the nonnegative scalar
            \[ \|v\| = \sqrt{v \cdot v}.\]
            Also, a vector whose length is 1  is called a <strong>unit vector</strong>
            \[u = \frac{v}{\|v\|}\]
            that maintains its "direction." We call this process <strong>normalization</strong>, which
            is useful in many applications such as machine learning.
