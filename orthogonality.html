        <h1>Inner Product </h1>
        <blockquote>
            The <strong>inner product</strong> of vectors \(u, v \in \mathbb{R}^n \) is a single scalar
            \[u \cdot v = u^Tv = u_1v_1 + \cdots + u_nv_n.\]
            <br>
            We need the definition of the "length" in higher dimension. 
            The <strong>norm</strong> of a vector \(v \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the nonnegative scalar
            \[ \|v\| = \sqrt{v \cdot v}.\]
            Also, a vector whose length is 1  is called a <strong>unit vector</strong>
            \[u = \frac{v}{\|v\|}\]
            that maintains its "direction." We call this process <strong>normalization</strong>, which
            is useful in many applications such as machine learning. 
            Since we got a "length," now we can define the <strong>distance</strong> between vectors
            \(u, v \in \mathbb{R}^n \) as
            \[dist(u, v) = \|u - v\|. \] 
            <br>
            Geometrically, \(dist(u, v) \text{ and } dist(u, -v)\) are perpendicular iff they are the same.
            \[\|u - v\|^2 = (u-v) \cdot (u-v) = u \cdots (u-v) + (-v) \cdot (u - v) = \|u\|^2 - 2u \cdot v + \|v\|^2\] 
            \[\|u - (-v)\|^2 = (u+v) \cdot (u+v) = u \cdots (u+v) + (v) \cdot (u + v) = \|u\|^2 + 2u \cdot v + \|v\|^2\]
            You might notice that these are close to the Pythagorean theorem:\(\|u - (-v)\|^2 = \|u\|^2 + \|v\|^2 \) iff 
            \(u\) and \(v\) are orthogonal. So, we need \(- 2u \cdot v = + 2u \cdot v\) for the general orthogonality as follows.
            <br>
            Two vectors \(u, v \in \mathbb{R}^n \) are <strong>orthogonal</strong> to each other if their inner product \(u \cdot v =0\).
