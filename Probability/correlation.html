        <h1>Cross-covariance</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Often we want to handle multiple datasets or different sets of variables that are related but might 
            not be directly comparable in terms of the data structures. In such a case, <strong>cross-covariance</strong> 
            measures the covariance between different pairs of variables from different datasets.
            <br><br>
            For example, consider two different datasets \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n_1}\) and \(B \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n_2}\). 
            We can compute the <strong>cross-covariance matrix</strong>:
            \[
            C_{AB} = \frac{1}{m-1}A^TB
            \]
            (Both dataset \(A\) and \(B\) must have the same number of data points.)
            <br>
            Note: C_{AA} is called the <strong>auto-covariance matrix</strong>, which is the same as the covariance matrix that 
            we discussed in Part 1. 
        </blockquote>

        <h1>Correlation</h1>
        <blockquote>
            The magnitude of the covariance between two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) depends on the units of the variables, we 
            <strong>standardize</strong> the covariance by the standard deviation of the variables: 
            \[
            \sigma_X  = \mathbb{E}[(X - \mathbb{E}[X])^2]  \text{ and } \sigma_Y  = \mathbb{E}[(Y - \mathbb{E}[Y])^2]
            \]
            Then we obtain the <strong>correlation coefficient</strong> between \(X\) and \(Y\) quantifies the strength 
            and direction of their <strong>linear</strong> relationship: 
            \[
            \rho = \text{corr }[X, Y] = \frac{\text{Cov }[X, Y]}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}.
            \]
            Now it it easy to compare across different datasets.
