        <h1>Entropy</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Consider you play a number guessing game. You have to guess a natural number between 1 and 100. If I tell you that the number is not 1, then 
            you still have 99 possible choices. So, this information is not valuable. In this case, we can say that the <strong>information content</strong> 
            of this clue is low. However, if I tell you that the number is divisible by 11, the number of choices is reduced to 9 only and thus the information 
            content of this clue is much higher. 
            <br><br>
            This example illustrates that information content (or <strong>self-information</strong>) measures the "uncertainty" associated with an 
            event. The lower the probability of an event, the higher its information content.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Entropy</strong> extends this concept by quantifying the average information content across all possible outcomes of a 
            random variable \(X\).
            <br>
            The <strong>entropy</strong> of a discrete random variable \(X\) with distribution \(p\) over 
            \(K\) states is defined as:
            \[
            \mathbb{H}(X) = - \sum_{k=1}^K p(X = k) \log p(X = k) = - \mathbb{E }_X [\log p(X)]
            \]
            Note: The choice of logarithmic base determines the units of entropy:
            Using base 2 results in entropy measured in <strong>bits</strong>, reflecting the binary number.
            <br>
            Using the natural logarithm (base \(e\)), results in entropy measured in <strong>nats</strong>.
